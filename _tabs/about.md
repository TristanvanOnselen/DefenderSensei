With a strong passion for cybersecurity and Microsoft Cloud technologies, I help organizations strengthen their security posture and operational resilience. As a seasoned Security Architect, I design scalable, compliant security architectures aligned with DORA, NIS2, and ISO 27001. I have led SIEM/XDR implementations, Zero Trust initiatives, and vulnerability management programs.

Beyond strategy and implementation, I advise C-level executives and security teams, fostering a **Grow Together** mindset. As a Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) and speaker, I share my expertise to empower organizations, ensuring cybersecurity is not just a necessity but a driver for innovation, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
